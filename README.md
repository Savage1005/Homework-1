# Homework1
My first homework assignment
For this project, I was tasked to clean up a website by making it more accessible by using semantic tags and alt attributes.  In the process, I also consolidated many of the class tags to make them less redundant and more presentable. I gave the website a title. I also assigned what I thought were the proper semantics to each section of the website.  I also added alt attributes to each image and reorganized a little bit of the html so that it looks more presentable.
